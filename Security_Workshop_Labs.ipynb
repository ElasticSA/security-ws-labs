        "\n",
        "The overview page contains: a __search bar__ and a __timepicker__ (the same as you will find in any other part of kibana); a __signals histogram__; an __external alerts histogram__; an __events histogram__; and a breakdown of the common event types usually ingested, recent cases and timelines, as well as a real time news feed maintained by the Elastic security teams.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### **The search bar and time picker:**\n",
        "Kibana uses a query language known as KQL (kibana query language). You can apply a search here to filter for specific events you may be interested in. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "       `host.name:myhostname.local and source.ip:10.30.0.0/16`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* ### **Signal Count:**\n",
        "Signals are events which Elastic SIEM has detected as being potentially malicious, based off of the inbuilt set of detection rules, or any custom rules that a user has created. The histogram allows you to change the stacking of the chart based on user preference.\n",

        "You can ship any logs and events that you like to the Elastic stack, including those from other security vendors which may have their own rule sets (IDS/IPS, WAF, AV/Endpoint solutions, etc). We visualise these in a separate chart that we label as external alerts. This chart will get populated by any logs/events which contain the field `event.kind: alert`. As part of these excercises, we will not have any external alerts, however, here is an example of a populated chart below:\n",

        "\n",
        "As we saw during our hunt, the malware sample we executed tried to exfiltrate data over the DNS protocol. There were several DNS queries with very long and unusual sub domains for the same registered domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "This particular detection rule is based off of Elastic's [unsupervised machine learning](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-machine-learning) jobs. The SIEM has a job built in that is modelling DNS queries over time - specifically, the length of the subdomain. When it notices that a registered domain has several unusually long subdomains in a given time period, it will calculate the probability of that happening in our environment, and generate an anomaly score out of it. Since it is an unsupervised model, it will learn over time. There is no need for a user to influence this.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an extremely effective way of detecting an event like DNS tunneling, as it eliminates the need for a user to have to \"guess\" what the right values are i a traditional, static query - \"How many subdomains should a registered domain have? How long should they be? What time of the day should I filter for?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at the details of why this machine learning job spotted an anomaly, and, in turn, caused the associated detection to trigger.\n",

Whilst there is a fair amount of detail, this is listing out the probability of this happening in our environment (you can see it's extremely low), the mathematical function used (`high_info_content`) what the typical number of queries is for this domain (~34 in the screenshot above) and the actual number of queries with long subdomains that we saw ingested (506). You can also see the same `withyourface.com` domain that we saw in our hunt, as we expected. There are more specific machine learning fields if an analyst wants to five into more detail.
